# Caddy K8s Ingress Controller

The Caddy K8s Ingress Controller includes functionality for monitoring `Ingress` resources on a Kubernetes cluster. It is capable of provisioning SSL/TLS certificates automatically for all hostnames defined in the ingress resources that it is managing.

## Notes on this fork

- **This ingress controller works with Cloudflare** (as of v0.3.0/1.4.0) to perform DNS-based challenges for auto-generated certificates. A Cloudflare API key with Zone.Zone:Read and Zone.DNS:Edit is needed to use this functionality, along with a private HTTP endpoint that approves a given domain for automatic certificate generation. 
- **It is also configured to write auto-generated certificates to the source ingress namespace instead of the Caddy installation namespace.** This aligns with established K8s best practices regarding namespace-constrained secret access (as of v0.4.0/1.5.0).
- Created to update dependencies and include the latest version of Caddy when building the ingress-controller binary
- Several security scanners have been added to the repo to ensure any issues are found quickly
- Will be maintained (depenencies/packages updated & CVEs addressed in a timely manner, etc.)

## Prerequisites

- Helm 3+
- Kubernetes 1.19+

## Setup

In the `charts` folder, a Helm Chart is provided to make installing the Caddy
Ingress Controller on a Kubernetes cluster straightforward. To install the
Caddy Ingress Controller adhere to the following steps:

1. Add the Helm chart:

```sh
helm repo add caddy-ingress https://davidiven.github.io/caddy-ingress/
```

2. Create a new namespace in your cluster to isolate all Caddy resources.

```sh
kubectl create namespace caddy-system
```

3. Create a Kubernetes opaque secret named "cloudflare-api-token" with the following key and value:

- CF_API_TOKEN / your Cloudflare API token with Zone.Zone:Read and Zone.DNS:Edit permissions for the domain(s) you're managing with Caddy

```sh
kubectl create secret generic cloudflare-api-token \
  --from-literal=CF_API_TOKEN=your_cloudflare_api_token \
  -n caddy-system
```

4. (a) Install the Helm chart:

```sh
helm install caddy-ingress caddy-ingress/caddy-ingress-controller \
  --namespace=caddy-system 
```

4. (b) Install the Helm chart with on-demand TLS enabled:

```sh
helm install caddy-ingress caddy-ingress/caddy-ingress-controller \
  --namespace=caddy-system \
  --set ingressController.config.email=your@email.com \
  --set ingressController.config.onDemandTLS=true \
  --set ingressController.config.acmeDNSProvider=cloudflare \
  --set ingressController.config.acmeDNSResolvers[0]=1.1.1.1 \
  --set ingressController.config.permissionEndpoint=http://your-permission-endpoint
```

Note: Caddy expects to be able to query a local HTTP endpoint and receive an HTTP 200 OK response
for domains authorized for on-demand TLS. See [this link](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/tls/automation/on_demand/permission/http) for details. 

This will create a service of type `LoadBalancer` in the `caddy-system`
namespace on your cluster. You'll want to set any DNS records for accessing this
cluster to the external IP address of this `LoadBalancer` when the external IP
is provisioned by your cloud provider.

You can get the external IP address with `kubectl get svc -n caddy-system`

## Debugging

To view any logs generated by Caddy or the Ingress Controller you can view the
pod logs of the Caddy Ingress Controller.

Get the pod name with:

```sh
kubectl get pods -n caddy-system
```

View the pod logs:

```sh
kubectl logs <pod-name> -n caddy-system
```

## Automatic HTTPS

To have automatic HTTPS (not to be confused with `On-demand TLS`), you simply have
to specify your email in the config map. When using Helm chart, you can add
`--set ingressController.config.email=your@email.com` when installing.

## On-Demand TLS

[On-demand TLS](https://caddyserver.com/docs/automatic-https#on-demand-tls) can generate SSL certs on the fly
and can be enabled in this controller by setting the `onDemandTLS` config to `true`:

```sh
helm install ...\
  --set ingressController.config.onDemandTLS=true
```

## Bringing Your Own Certificates

If you would like to disable automatic HTTPS for a specific host and use your
own certificates you can create a new TLS secret in Kubernetes and define what
certificates to use when serving your application on the ingress resource.

Example:

Create TLS secret `mycerts`, where `./tls.key` and `./tls.crt` are valid
certificates for `test.com`.

```
kubectl create secret tls mycerts --key ./tls.key --cert ./tls.crt
```

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: example
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: caddy
spec:
  rules:
  - host: test.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: test
            port:
              number: 8080
  tls:
    - secretName: mycerts # use mycerts for host test.com
      hosts:
        - test.com
```
